# Battery Landscape Research – Multi-Agent Instructions

> Read and analyze the task description in `/battery/battery-research.md`.  
> Do not begin execution immediately.

### Step 1: Critical Review
Conduct a critical review of the prompt. Break it down into its logical components, required deliverables, technical domains, and implied research challenges.

### Step 2: Agent Generation
Based on this analysis, generate as many distinct, highly specialized AI agents as necessary to accomplish the task with maximum accuracy and efficiency.

---

### For Each Agent
1. Define a detailed persona that outlines their professional background, domain expertise, years of experience, and core skill set.  
   Emphasize specialization and precision.
2. Assign a clear, narrowly scoped subtask derived from the main objective in `/battery/battery-research.md`.
3. The subtask should include measurable goals and quality constraints.
4. Create a task-specific prompt that begins with the persona description and is tailored to the agent’s domain.

### Coordination
All agents must operate in **parallel** or **logical sequence** where dependencies exist.  
Each agent’s output should be clearly attributed and modular so it can be integrated into a final synthesized deliverable.

If any ambiguity or inconsistency exists within the source task, generate a **meta-agent** to flag and resolve these gaps before execution proceeds.

### Architecture Requirements
Ensure the overall agent architecture supports:
- Task decomposition  
- Parallelization  
- Modular recomposition  
- Accuracy assurance  
- Role transparency

### Execution
Once the agents are defined and their prompts constructed, begin execution in the optimal order —  
using the most effective agent for each segment of the research task.
