## Core Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Industry Mapping**
   - Identify and categorize every significant player in the U.S. battery sector.  
     This includes companies such as **EOSE, AMPX, QS, CWEN, ABAT, FLNC**, and others operating in:
     - Lithium-ion, solid-state, and flow battery manufacturing  
     - Grid-scale and distributed storage solutions  
     - Component supply chains (anodes, cathodes, electrolytes, separators)  
     - Recycling and materials recovery  
     - Financing, private equity, and government funding arms  

2. **Temporal & Historical Analysis**
   - Map the evolution of the industry from early research and pilot programs to the gigafactory boom.  
   - Track major **policy interventions** (DOE programs, IRA incentives) and **private sector expansions**.

3. **Financial & Investment Layer**
   - Aggregate information from 10-K filings, investor presentations, and institutional research.  
   - Identify ownership structures, capital inflows, and equity/funding relationships across the ecosystem.  
   - Summarize **valuation trends**, **market share dynamics**, and **competitive advantages**.

4. **Forecast & Future Outlook**
   - Model likely growth trajectories through 2030+, incorporating analyst projections, technology cost curves, and policy dependencies.  
   - Highlight upcoming inflection points in battery chemistry, energy density, cost per kWh, and recycling efficiency.

5. **Public Source Integrity**
   - All research must originate from **reputable, publicly accessible sources**, including but not limited to:  
     - SEC filings, DOE/EIA publications  
     - McKinsey, BloombergNEF, Wood Mackenzie reports  
     - Credible institutional and university research  
     - Verified industry and trade press

## Specific Objectives

1. **Catalog all active and emerging companies** in the U.S. battery ecosystem and classify them by sub-sector and stage of commercialization.  
2. **Track ownership and investment linkages**, identifying corporate parents, venture backers, and government support programs.  
3. **Analyze financial health and R&D intensity** for leading firms (R&D/revenue %, cash flow runway, CapEx scale).  
4. **Corroborate findings** with cross-referenced filings, earnings calls, and analyst notes.  
5. **Identify geographic patterns** (Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Midwest) in manufacturing and deployment.  
6. **Assess policy exposure** — quantify which firms benefit most from current or pending federal/state incentives.  
7. **Output findings in a structured format**, such as:
   - Tabular datasets (Company | Sub-sector | Headquarters | Funding | Stage | Source)
   - Knowledge graphs mapping ownership/investment relationships
   - Analytical summaries with citations

## Platform Implementation Goals

1. **Website Development**
   - Create a web portal that visualizes the research database with:
     - Interactive dashboards  
     - Company profiles  
     - Historical and forecast data  
     - Search and filter functionality  

2. **Conversational Agent Integration**
   - Implement a **chatbot** capable of answering research-grade questions using the verified dataset and documents.  
   - Chatbot must:
     - Retrieve factual data with full citation  
     - Avoid speculative or unverified commentary  
     - Synthesize information from multiple verified documents  

3. **API and Backend**
   - Develop a structured backend (SQL/NoSQL + RAG pipeline) that serves:
     - Company metadata  
     - Financial summaries  
     - Linked source documents  
     - Semantic embeddings for chatbot use  

4. **Data Integrity Layer**
   - Every data object or claim must be accompanied by:
     - Source type (SEC, DOE, Analyst)  
     - URL or citation  
     - Date of publication  
     - Confidence score

## Expected Deliverables

- **Battery Intelligence Corpus** — verified database of companies, technologies, and investors  
- **Analytical Reports** — historical analysis + 2030+ forecast summaries  
- **Interactive Web Dashboard** — full visualization of the sector  
- **Chatbot Interface** — RAG-based model that answers user questions using the curated corpus  
- **API Access Layer** — endpoints for third-party research or expansion  

---

## Analytical Directives

- Be **skeptical**, **exhaustive**, and **data-driven**.  
- Always cross-validate corporate statements against filings, regulatory data, and independent analyst reports.  
- Highlight inconsistencies, over-optimistic projections, or non-disclosed relationships.  
- Triangulate evidence — treat headlines as starting points, not conclusions.
