            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>This comprehensive report maps the U.S. battery industry policy landscape, analyzing federal incentive programs established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Department of Energy (DOE) loan programs, state-level incentives, and regulatory frameworks. The analysis reveals that the U.S. battery manufacturing sector has attracted approximately <strong>$198 billion in announced investments</strong> with potential to create <strong>195,000 jobs</strong>, heavily supported by federal tax credits totaling $10 billion in 48C allocations and production-based 45X credits. However, political uncertainty in 2025 poses significant risks to this nascent industry, with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) threatening to phase out key tax incentives.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Federal Support:</strong> $10 billion in 48C grants, unlimited 45X production credits ($35/kWh cells, $10/kWh modules), and $50+ billion in DOE lending authority</li>
                <li><strong>State Competition:</strong> Georgia leads with $3.3 billion in combined incentives, followed by Tennessee ($900M), Michigan ($1.8B original/$384-409M revised), and North Carolina ($1.2B)</li>
                <li><strong>Sector Investment:</strong> $198 billion in announced battery/EV manufacturing investments, with $48.3 billion specifically in battery manufacturing and 62,700 jobs created (as of June 2025)</li>
                <li><strong>Political Risk:</strong> HIGH (8/10) - OBBBA phases out 30D and 45X credits; potential loss of 130,000 direct and 310,000 indirect jobs by 2030 if IRA repealed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Regulatory Framework</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules</h3>
            <p>FEOC restrictions, implemented under IRA Section 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), prohibit battery components and critical minerals from entities owned/controlled by China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran from qualifying for consumer EV tax credits.</p>

            <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
            <p><strong>Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC):</strong> An entity that meets one or more of the following criteria:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Incorporation/Domicile Test:</strong> Incorporated, domiciled, or has principal place of business in a covered nation (China, Russia, North Korea, Iran)</li>
                <li><strong>Activity Test:</strong> Participates in extraction, processing, or recycling of critical minerals OR manufacturing/assembly of battery components in a covered nation</li>
                <li><strong>Ownership Test:</strong> Owned or controlled 25% or more by a covered foreign entity</li>
                <li><strong>Effective Control Test:</strong> Contracts, licensing agreements, or other arrangements that give effective control over critical mineral extraction or component assembly</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Critical Distinction:</strong> FEOC restrictions apply ONLY to 30D consumer tax credit (vehicles)</li>
                <li><strong>Section 45X:</strong> Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit has NO FEOC restrictions</li>
                <li><strong>Section 48C:</strong> Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit has NO current FEOC restrictions</li>
                <li><strong>Implication:</strong> U.S. battery manufacturers can use Chinese equipment, processes, or technology and still claim 45X credits, as long as production occurs domestically and components are sold to unrelated parties</li>
                <li><strong>Potential Risk:</strong> Congressional proposals to extend FEOC restrictions to 45X exist but have not been enacted as of November 2025</li>

            <h3>4.2 Durability Score: 8/10 (MODERATE-HIGH POLITICAL RISK)</h3>
            <p><strong>Score: 8/10</strong> - High probability of significant modifications, but outright repeal unlikely</p>

            <h4>Factors Increasing Durability (Supporting 8+):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Investments Already Made:</strong> $48.3 billion in battery manufacturing sunk costs; repealing credits would strand assets</li>
                <li><strong>Job Creation:</strong> 62,700 direct jobs created, concentrated in politically important states (GA, MI, TN, NC, KY)</li>
                <li><strong>Bipartisan State Support:</strong> Republican governors in GA, TN, KY actively defending investments in their states</li>
                <li><strong>National Security Argument:</strong> Reduced dependence on Chinese battery supply chain resonates with both parties</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Resilience:</strong> Post-COVID emphasis on domestic manufacturing has bipartisan support</li>

            <h4>Factors Decreasing Durability (Limiting to 8):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>OBBBA Passage:</strong> Demonstrates willingness to roll back IRA provisions</li>
                <li><strong>Fiscal Pressure:</strong> $154B potential 45X liability over 10 years creates budget target</li>
                <li><strong>EV Sales Slowdown:</strong> 2024-2025 EV demand plateau undermines urgency argument</li>
                <li><strong>China Exposure:</strong> Many battery plants still rely on Chinese cathode materials, equipment (FEOC concerns)</li>
                <li><strong>Political Polarization:</strong> EV transition increasingly partisan issue</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The U.S. battery industry policy landscape has created unprecedented momentum for domestic manufacturing investment, with <strong>$198 billion in announced investments</strong> and <strong>62,700 jobs created</strong> as of June 2025. However, the sector faces significant political risk with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and ongoing debates about IRA tax credit sustainability.</p>

            <p>The base case scenario (50% probability) anticipates a managed phase-down of federal incentives, with 30D consumer credits eliminated in September 2025 and 45X manufacturing credits reduced by 40% starting in 2026. This would result in 15-25% project cancellations but preserve the majority of committed investments, particularly those with state-level incentive support and binding OEM offtake agreements.</p>

            <p>States have emerged as critical actors in this ecosystem, with Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, North Carolina, and Kentucky offering combined incentives exceeding $7 billion to secure battery manufacturing facilities. This state-level competition, combined with bipartisan support from governors in key manufacturing states, provides a degree of policy durability even as federal incentives face uncertainty.</p>

            <p><strong>Next Update Recommended:</strong> January 2026 (following 30D credit expiration and any 45X regulatory changes)</p>
