## KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Material-Specific Vulnerabilities (2024)

| Material | Risk Level | China Dependency | Primary Vulnerability | 2030 Outlook |
|----------|------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Graphite** | CATASTROPHIC (10/10) | 95% processing | No alternatives to Chinese spherical graphite | HIGH (7/10) - 50% dependent |
| **Cobalt** | CRITICAL (8/10) | 65% refining | 70% from unstable DRC + China processing | HIGH (6/10) - Recycling helps |
| **Lithium** | HIGH (6/10) | 60% refining | China refines most Australian/Chilean ore | MEDIUM (4/10) - Strong progress |
| **Nickel** | MEDIUM-HIGH (5/10) | 45% processing | Russia sanctioned, Indonesia low-grade | MEDIUM-LOW (3/10) - Canadian alternative |

### Critical Domestic Projects (Must Succeed for 2030 Targets)

**Lithium**:
- Thacker Pass (NV): 40,000 tonnes/yr - Permitting lawsuit pending - 2027 target
- Kings Mountain (NC): 30,000 tonnes/yr - Construction phase - 2027 target
- ExxonMobil Arkansas: 110,000 tonnes/yr lithium hydroxide - 2027 target

**Nickel/Cobalt**:
- Tamarack (MN): 60,000 tonnes Ni/yr - Environmental review - 2028 target at risk

**Graphite**:
- Graphite One (AK): 42,000 tonnes/yr - Feasibility study only - 2029+ target
- Westwater (AL): 7,500 tonnes/yr - Permitting delays - 2026 target slipping

**If These Projects Fail**: U.S. remains 70-80% import dependent (same as 2024)

### Recycling Breakthrough (2030 Projections)

| Material | Recycled Supply | % of 2030 U.S. Demand | Strategic Impact |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Cobalt** | 18,000 tonnes/yr | 50%+ | Near-eliminates DRC dependency |
| **Nickel** | 75,000 tonnes/yr | 30% | Major import reduction |
| **Lithium** | 60,000 tonnes/yr | 12% | Growing contribution |
| **Graphite** | 15,000 tonnes/yr | 3% | Low recovery (degradation) |

**Key Recyclers**: Redwood Materials (100k tonnes/yr), Li-Cycle (65k tonnes/yr), Ascend Elements (30k tonnes/yr)

### Investment Required (2024-2030)

| Category | Investment | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Domestic Mining | $15B | Thacker Pass, Tamarack, Graphite One, etc. |
| Refining Capacity | $20B | Lithium hydroxide, nickel sulfate, graphite processing |
| Recycling Infrastructure | $10B | Redwood, Li-Cycle, Ascend expansions |
