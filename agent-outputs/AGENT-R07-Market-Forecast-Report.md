---

### 2.2 Realization Rate & Risk Adjustment

#### Historical Context
Not all announced gigafactory projects materialize. Based on global battery industry patterns (2015-2023):
- **Projects with secured financing:** 90% realization rate
- **Projects announced with OEM partnerships:** 85% realization rate
- **Projects announced without financing details:** 50-60% realization rate
- **Overall industry average:** 70-75% realization rate

**U.S. Specific Factors (Higher Realization):**
- IRA 45X tax credits reduce financial risk
- Many projects have OEM backing (captive demand)
- State incentive packages tied to job creation (political pressure to complete)
- DOE loan guarantees for select projects

**Adjusted Realization Rate for U.S. (2024-2030):** 75-80%

#### Realization-Adjusted Capacity Forecast

**Conservative Scenario (75% realization):**

| Year | Announced Capacity (GWh) | Realized Capacity (GWh) | Unrealized/Delayed (GWh) |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 2024 | 50 | 50 | 0 |
| 2025 | 180 | 162 | 18 |
| 2026 | 345 | 293 | 52 |
| 2027 | 555 | 458 | 97 |
| 2028 | 795 | 636 | 159 |
| 2029 | 1,070 | 838 | 232 |
| 2030 | 1,350 | 1,013 | 337 |

**Optimistic Scenario (80% realization):**
- 2030 Realized Capacity: 1,080 GWh

**Projects Most at Risk of Delay/Cancellation:**
- Facilities without named OEM offtake agreements
- Companies with weak balance sheets (pre-revenue startups)
- Projects announced pre-IRA without updated economics post-IRA
- Facilities in states with less generous incentive packages

---

### 2.3 Production Ramp Curve Analysis

#### Methodology
Battery gigafactories do not reach nameplate capacity immediately upon "start of production." Historical data from Tesla, LG Chem, CATL facilities shows typical ramp pattern:

**Industry Standard Ramp Curve:**
- **Year 1 (SOP):** 15-25% utilization (pilot production, line validation, yield improvement)
- **Year 2:** 40-60% utilization (volume ramp, customer qualification)
- **Year 3:** 70-85% utilization (approaching full capacity)
- **Year 4+:** 85-95% utilization (mature operations)

**Base Case Ramp Assumptions:**
- Year 1: 20% of nameplate
- Year 2: 50% of nameplate
- Year 3: 80% of nameplate
- Year 4+: 90% of nameplate

#### Effective Supply Calculation (2024-2030)

**Methodology:** For each facility, apply ramp curve based on years since SOP.

**Example: 100 GWh facility starting in 2027**
- 2027 (Year 1): 100 GWh × 0.20 = 20 GWh effective supply
- 2028 (Year 2): 100 GWh × 0.50 = 50 GWh effective supply
- 2029 (Year 3): 100 GWh × 0.80 = 80 GWh effective supply
- 2030 (Year 4): 100 GWh × 0.90 = 90 GWh effective supply

**Aggregate Effective Supply Forecast (Base Case: 75% realization):**

| Year | Realized Capacity (GWh) | Effective Supply (GWh) | Avg Utilization Rate |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 2024 | 50 | 45 | 90% |
| 2025 | 162 | 97 | 60% |
| 2026 | 293 | 176 | 60% |
| 2027 | 458 | 305 | 67% |
| 2028 | 636 | 450 | 71% |
| 2029 | 838 | 600 | 72% |
| 2030 | 1,013 | 730 | 72% |

**Key Insights:**
- Average utilization remains 70-75% through 2030 due to continuous new facility additions
- By 2035, as facility base matures, utilization expected to reach 85-90%
- Effective supply lags announced capacity by 3-4 years

**Optimistic Scenario (80% realization, faster ramp):**
- 2030 Effective Supply: 780 GWh

**Conservative Scenario (70% realization, slower ramp):**
- 2030 Effective Supply: 680 GWh

- **NMC:** 35-40% (premium EVs requiring higher energy density)
- **NCA:** 3-5% (Tesla, some premium models)
- **Solid-State:** 2-3% (pilot production, premium segment only)
- **Other (Sodium-ion, advanced):** 2-5% (grid storage applications)

**Key Trends Driving Mix Shift:**
1. **LFP/LMFP Adoption:**
   - Ford, GM, Tesla shifting mass-market models to LFP
   - Lower cost: $80/kWh (LFP) vs $95/kWh (NMC) at cell level (2024)
   - Longer cycle life (grid storage advantage)
   - Reduced supply chain risk (no cobalt/nickel dependence)

2. **NMC Evolution:**
   - High-nickel NMC (90%+ Ni) for premium EVs (400+ mile range)
   - Declining share but still critical for performance segment
   - Cobalt content reducing: 10-20% → 5-10% by 2030

3. **Solid-State Delays:**
   - QuantumScape, Solid Power timelines pushed to 2027-2028 for pilot production
   - Limited commercial volume before 2030
   - Cost parity not expected until 2032-2035

**Regional Considerations:**
- **Southeastern gigafactories:** Primarily LFP/LMFP (mass-market focus)
- **Nevada/Western facilities:** Mix of NMC and LFP
- **Michigan facilities:** Balanced mix (GM Ultium supports both)

## 3. Supply-Demand Balance Analysis

### 3.1 Annual Supply-Demand Balance (2024-2030)

#### Comprehensive Balance Table

| Year | Total Demand (GWh) | Announced Capacity (GWh) | Realized Capacity (GWh) | Effective Supply (GWh) | Surplus/(Deficit) (GWh) | Import Dependence |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 2024 | 146 | 50 | 50 | 45 | (101) | 69% |
| 2025 | 197 | 180 | 162 | 97 | (100) | 51% |
| 2026 | 266 | 345 | 293 | 176 | (90) | 34% |
| 2027 | 355 | 555 | 458 | 305 | (50) | 14% |
| 2028 | 468 | 795 | 636 | 450 | (18) | 4% |
| 2029 | 600 | 1,070 | 838 | 600 | 0 | 0% |
| 2030 | 710 | 1,350 | 1,013 | 730 | +20 | 0% |

**Import Dependence = Deficit / Total Demand × 100%**

#### Key Findings

**2024-2026: High Import Dependence Phase**
- U.S. relies on imports for 34-69% of battery demand
- Primary import sources: South Korea (SK On, LG Energy Solution), Japan (Panasonic), China (limited due to IRA domestic content rules)
- OEMs stockpiling imported cells to bridge capacity gap

**2027-2028: Transition to Self-Sufficiency**
- Rapid capacity additions reduce deficit from 50 GWh to 18 GWh
- Import dependence falls below 15%
- Critical inflection year: **2027** (multiple gigafactories reach full ramp)

**2029: Self-Sufficiency Achieved**
- Effective supply matches demand (~600 GWh)
- **First year of zero structural deficit**
- Regional imbalances may still drive selective imports

**2030: Modest Surplus**
- 20 GWh surplus (3% overcapacity)
- Positions U.S. for potential battery exports to Canada/Mexico (USMCA)
- Provides buffer for demand uncertainty

---

### 3.2 Regional Supply-Demand Imbalances

#### Regional Analysis (2030)

**Southeast (GA, TN, KY, NC, SC, AL):**
- **Capacity:** 450+ GWh
- **Regional Demand:** 300 GWh (proximity to automotive corridor)
- **Balance:** +150 GWh surplus (regional export hub)

**Midwest (MI, OH, IN, IL):**
- **Capacity:** 230 GWh
- **Regional Demand:** 220 GWh
- **Balance:** +10 GWh (balanced)

**West (NV, TX, CA, AZ):**
- **Capacity:** 200 GWh
- **Regional Demand:** 150 GWh (CA EV market + grid storage)
- **Balance:** +50 GWh surplus

**Northeast (NY, PA, NJ, etc.):**
- **Capacity:** 30 GWh
- **Regional Demand:** 40 GWh
- **Balance:** -10 GWh deficit (smaller facilities, imports from Southeast)

**Implications:**
- Southeast becomes "Battery Belt" (similar to historical automotive concentration)
- Logistics optimization: Battery weight/cost favors regional production-consumption alignment
- Regional grid storage demand less location-sensitive (can absorb surplus capacity)

---

### 3.3 Technology Mismatch Risk Analysis

#### Scenario: Faster-than-Expected LFP Adoption

**Risk:** If consumer/OEM preference shifts more aggressively toward LFP (cost-driven), but facilities built for NMC production:

**Current Announced Mix (based on company disclosures):**
- NMC-capable facilities: 600 GWh (45%)
- LFP-capable facilities: 550 GWh (40%)
- Chemistry-agnostic facilities: 200 GWh (15%)

**2030 Demand Scenario (Aggressive LFP Shift):**
- LFP demand: 450 GWh (63% of 710 GWh total)
- NMC demand: 220 GWh (31%)
- Other: 40 GWh (6%)

**Mismatch Analysis:**
- LFP supply: 550 GWh (sufficient, +100 GWh surplus)
- NMC supply: 600 GWh (overcapacity of 380 GWh)

**Mitigation Factors:**
1. Many facilities can switch between chemistries with equipment modifications (6-12 months, capital investment)
2. Longer-term contracts give OEMs/facility operators advance notice
3. Export markets (EU, other regions) may absorb U.S. NMC surplus

**Likelihood:** Medium risk (30% probability of >10% overcapacity in specific chemistry)

**Sources:** BloombergNEF, NREL

**Key Observations:**
1. **Long-term decline:** 92% cost reduction from 2010 ($1,160) to 2024 ($95)
2. **Volatility (2021-2022):** Lithium price spike caused temporary cost increase
3. **2023-2024 collapse:** Lithium prices normalized, overcapacity in China drove aggressive pricing
4. **Critical threshold crossed:** 2024 pack costs fell below $100/kWh (EV-ICE parity point)

---

### 4.2 Learning Curve Analysis (Wright's Law)

#### Methodology

**Wright's Law (1936):**
> For every cumulative doubling of units produced, costs decline by a constant percentage.

**Formula:**
```
C(x) = C₀ × (x / x₀)^(-b)

Where:
- C(x) = cost at cumulative production x
- C₀ = initial cost at production x₀
- b = learning rate exponent
- Learning rate (%) = 1 - 2^(-b)
```

**Historical Learning Rate for Li-ion Batteries:**
- **BloombergNEF:** 18% learning rate (cost drops 18% per doubling)
- **Academic studies:** 16-20% range
- **Base Case:** 18% learning rate (conservative)

#### Validation Against Historical Data

**2010-2024 Cumulative Production & Cost:**
- 2010: 0.01 TWh cumulative, $1,160/kWh
- 2024: 1.30 TWh cumulative, $95/kWh

**Doublings:** 1.30 / 0.01 = 130 → log₂(130) = 7.02 doublings

**Predicted 2024 Cost (18% learning rate):**
```
C(2024) = $1,160 × (1 - 0.18)^7.02
C(2024) = $1,160 × 0.82^7.02
C(2024) = $1,160 × 0.286
C(2024) = $332/kWh
```

**Actual 2024 Cost:** $95/kWh

**Analysis:**
- Model significantly overpredicts (predicts $332 vs actual $95)
- Indicates learning rate accelerated beyond 18%, or additional factors:
  1. **Technology improvements** not captured in simple production scaling (dry electrode, tabless design)
  2. **Material cost reductions** independent of scale (lithium extraction efficiency)
  3. **Competitive overcapacity** in China (selling below cost to maintain volume)

**Adjusted Learning Rate (2010-2024):** ~22-24% (to match observed data)

### 4.3 Cost Forecast (2024-2030)

#### Scenario Modeling

**Assumptions for Base Case:**
- **Learning Rate:** 18% (conservative, assumes 2023-2024 drop partially due to one-time factors)
- **Cumulative Global Production (2024-2030):**
  - 2024: 1.30 TWh
  - 2027: 2.80 TWh (annual production ~600 GWh/year globally)
  - 2030: 5.00 TWh (annual production ~850 GWh/year globally)
- **Material Cost Trajectory:** Lithium prices stabilize at $15-20/kg (lithium carbonate), down from $80/kg peak (2022)

**Base Case Forecast (18% Learning Rate):**

| Year | Cumulative Global Production (TWh) | Doublings from 2024 | Pack Cost ($/kWh) | Cell Cost ($/kWh) |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2024 | 1.30 | 0.00 | $95 | $71 |
| 2025 | 1.90 | 0.55 | $85 | $63 |
| 2026 | 2.60 | 1.00 | $78 | $58 |
| 2027 | 3.40 | 1.39 | $72 | $53 |
| 2028 | 4.30 | 1.73 | $66 | $49 |
| 2029 | 5.30 | 2.03 | $62 | $46 |
| 2030 | 6.50 | 2.32 | $58 | $43 |

**Optimistic Scenario (22% learning rate + technology breakthroughs):**
- 2030 Pack Cost: $42/kWh
- Drivers: Solid-state pilot production, dry electrode adoption (Tesla 4680 scaled), sodium-ion for low-end segment

**Pessimistic Scenario (15% learning rate + material cost rebound):**
- 2030 Pack Cost: $72/kWh
- Drivers: Lithium supply constraints, geopolitical disruptions (China export restrictions), slower scale-up

#### Technology Impact on Costs (2024-2030)

**Key Cost Reduction Technologies:**

1. **Dry Electrode Manufacturing (Tesla 4680, etc.):**
   - Potential cost reduction: 10-15%
   - Eliminates solvent use (NMP), reduces energy/capital costs
   - Adoption timeline: 10-20% of production by 2030

2. **Cell-to-Pack (CTP) & Cell-to-Body (CTB) Design:**
   - Reduces module assembly costs
   - 5-10% pack-level savings
   - Adoption: 30-40% of new facilities by 2030

3. **Silicon Anode Materials:**
   - Energy density increase: 15-20%
   - Fewer cells needed per pack (cost reduction via reduced cell count)
   - Adoption: 20-30% of cells by 2030 (Sila Nano, Amprius)

4. **LFP/LMFP Chemistry Shift:**
   - Inherently lower cost: $80/kWh (LFP) vs $95/kWh (NMC) at 2024 cell level
   - Market shift from 35% → 55% LFP lowers blended average cost

**Combined Technology Impact:** -$8-12/kWh additional reduction beyond learning curve (captured in optimistic scenario)

---

### 4.4 Cost Parity Analysis

#### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Parity

**Achieved in 2024:**
- Battery pack costs fell below $100/kWh
- TCO parity reached for most vehicle segments when comparing over 6-year ownership:
  - Lower fuel costs (electricity vs gasoline)
  - Lower maintenance costs (fewer moving parts)
  - Higher upfront cost offset by operational savings

**Evidence:**
- Goldman Sachs: $82/kWh achieves unsubsidized TCO parity
- Vincentric (2025): 24 of 54 EV models have lower 5-year TCO than ICE equivalents (without $7,500 tax credit)

#### Purchase Price Parity (Sticker Price)

**Definition:** EV and ICE vehicles have same MSRP at point of sale (no subsidies)

**Current Status (2024):**
- Average EV price premium: $8,000-12,000 over comparable ICE
- Battery cost differential: $4,000-6,000 (at 60 kWh pack size × $66/kWh premium over ICE powertrain)

**Price Parity Timeline:**

**Scenario Analysis:**

| Scenario | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2030 |
|----------|------|------|------|------|
| **Optimistic** | Parity achieved (premium EVs) | Mass-market parity | Universal parity | EVs $2,000 cheaper |
| **Base Case** | $6,000 premium | $3,000 premium | Parity achieved | EVs $1,000 cheaper |
| **Pessimistic** | $8,000 premium | $5,000 premium | $2,000 premium | Parity achieved |

**Base Case Details:**
- **2025:** $6,000 EV premium (battery: $85/kWh, pack: 65 kWh → $5,525 pack, ICE powertrain ~$3,000 → net $2,500 premium from battery alone, plus EV-specific costs)
- **2026:** $3,000 premium
- **2027:** Sticker price parity achieved (battery: $72/kWh)
- **2030:** EVs $1,000 cheaper than ICE (battery: $58/kWh, manufacturing scale advantages offset)

**Critical Battery Cost for Purchase Price Parity:** ~$70-75/kWh (pack level)
- Expected to be reached: **2026-2027**

---

## 5. Inflection Points & Strategic Milestones

### 5.1 EV Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Parity

**Status:** ACHIEVED (2024)

**Evidence:**
- Battery pack costs: $95/kWh (2024), below $100/kWh threshold
- Multiple studies confirm TCO parity:

**Status:** Projected 2029-2030

**Pathway to Self-Sufficiency:**

| Year | Deficit (GWh) | Import Dependence (%) |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| 2024 | -101 | 69% |
| 2025 | -100 | 51% |
| 2026 | -90 | 34% |
| 2027 | -50 | 14% |
| 2028 | -18 | 4% |
| 2029 | 0 | 0% |
| 2030 | +20 | 0% (surplus) |

**Critical Year: 2029**
- First year with zero structural deficit
- Effective supply (600 GWh) meets demand (600 GWh)

**2030: Export Potential**
- 20 GWh surplus enables USMCA exports (Canada, Mexico)
- Regional imbalances may still drive selective imports (e.g., Northeast imports from Southeast)

**Policy Dependency:**
- **Base Case (IRA maintained):** Self-sufficiency 2029-2030
- **IRA Modified (-50% credits):** Self-sufficiency delayed to 2032-2033
- **IRA Repealed:** Self-sufficiency not achieved by 2035 (35%+ import dependence remains)

**Strategic Importance:**
- **Energy Security:** Reduces dependence on South Korea, Japan, China for critical technology
- **Economic:** $80B+ domestic manufacturing investment (2022-2030)
- **Employment:** 200,000+ direct jobs by 2030 (per DOE estimates)
- **Geopolitical:** Strengthens Western battery supply chain vs China dominance

---

### 5.4 1 TWh (1,000 GWh) Annual Production Milestone

**Definition:** U.S. produces 1,000+ GWh of batteries in a single year

**Status:** Projected 2034-2035

**Trajectory to 1 TWh:**

| Year | U.S. Effective Supply (GWh) |
|------|---------------------------|
| 2024 | 45 |
| 2027 | 305 |
| 2030 | 730 |
| 2033 | 950 |
| 2035 | 1,050+ |

**Critical Year: 2034-2035**
- U.S. crosses 1 TWh annual production threshold
- **Context:** Global production already exceeded 1.2 TWh in 2023
- U.S. achieves milestone ~11 years after global market

**Implications:**
- Confirms U.S. as top 3 battery producer globally (behind China, likely behind EU)
- Enables domestic EV market >12M vehicles/year (assuming 75 kWh avg pack)
- Plus 300+ GWh for grid storage and exports

**Scenario Sensitivity:**
- **Optimistic:** 1 TWh by 2033 (if additional gigafactories announced 2025-2027)
- **Pessimistic:** 1 TWh not reached by 2035 (if IRA repealed, demand slower than forecast)

---

### 5.5 Solid-State Battery Commercialization

**Definition:** Solid-state batteries reach 10% U.S. market share

**Status:** Not projected by 2030; possible 2032-2034

**Current State (2024):**
- **QuantumScape (QS):** Pilot line QS-0 delivered to VW; QS-1 production line planned 2025-2026
- **Solid Power:** Pilot production for BMW, Ford; commercialization timeline 2027-2028
- **Toyota:** Announced solid-state EV by 2027-2028 (likely limited production)

**Challenges:**
1. **Manufacturing Scale:** No proven high-volume manufacturing process (>1 GWh/year)
2. **Cost:** Current prototypes 3-5× cost of Li-ion; learning curve unproven
3. **Performance:** Lab performance strong, but real-world durability/cycle life not validated at scale
4. **Timeline Slippage:** Historical delays of 3-4 years common in solid-state sector

**Forecast Timeline:**
- **2025-2026:** Pilot production (QuantumScape, Solid Power) - <0.1 GWh
- **2027-2028:** First commercial deliveries to OEMs (limited volume, premium vehicles) - 1-2 GWh
- **2029-2030:** Low-volume production (ultra-premium segment) - 5-10 GWh (1-1.5% market share)
- **2032-2034:** Scaled production begins - 50-70 GWh (potential for 10% market share if cost curve favorable)

**Probability Assessment:**
- **10% market share by 2030:** <20% probability (too aggressive)
- **10% market share by 2033:** 50% probability (medium confidence)
- **Solid-state remains <5% through 2035:** 40% probability (technology risk, cost challenges)

**Impact on Forecast:**
- Base case assumes <3% solid-state by 2030 (20 GWh of 710 GWh total demand)
- Does not materially impact supply-demand balance (mostly substitutes for NMC capacity)

---

### 5.6 LFP Market Share Dominance

**Definition:** LFP/LMFP chemistries exceed 50% of U.S. battery production

**Status:** Projected 2029-2030

**Current Market Share (2024):**
- **Global:** LFP ~45%, NMC ~50%, Other 5%
- **U.S.:** LFP ~35%, NMC ~60%, Other 5%
- **China:** LFP ~65% (cost-driven market)

**Drivers of LFP Growth:**
1. **Cost Advantage:** LFP cells $80/kWh vs NMC $95/kWh (2024)

   - Ford: Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning standard range (LFP from 2026)
   - GM: Equinox EV, future mass-market models (LFP)
3. **Supply Chain Security:** No cobalt/nickel dependence
4. **Grid Storage Preference:** LFP dominates (85%+ of grid deployments) due to longer cycle life
5. **Safety & Durability:** Lower thermal runaway risk, 3,000-5,000 cycles vs 1,500-2,500 for NMC

**Forecast Timeline:**

| Year | LFP/LMFP Market Share (U.S.) | NMC Market Share | Other |
|------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 2024 | 35% | 60% | 5% |
| 2026 | 42% | 52% | 6% |
| 2028 | 48% | 45% | 7% |
| 2030 | 53% | 38% | 9% |

**Critical Year: 2029-2030**
- LFP/LMFP surpasses 50% market share
- NMC relegated to premium/performance segment (long-range EVs >350 miles)

**LMFP (Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate) Emergence:**

- Bridges gap between LFP and NMC
- CATL, BYD leading development
- U.S. adoption timeline: 2027-2030 (10-15% of total LFP/LMFP by 2030)

**Implications:**
- Reduces U.S. dependence on cobalt (90% from DRC/Russia) and nickel (Indonesia, Russia)
- Aligns with IRA critical mineral sourcing requirements (easier compliance with LFP)
- Potential overcapacity risk in NMC-specific facilities

---

## 6. Policy Scenario Analysis

### 6.1 Scenario Framework

**Three Policy Scenarios (2025-2030):**

1. **Scenario A: IRA Maintained (Base Case)**
   - 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit: $35/kWh cells, $10/kWh modules (through 2032)
   - 48C Advanced Energy Credit: 30% ITC for manufacturing facilities
   - 30D Consumer EV Credit: $7,500 (with domestic content requirements)
   - Probability: 60%

2. **Scenario B: IRA Modified (Moderate Risk)**
   - 45X credits reduced by 50%: $17.50/kWh cells, $5/kWh modules
   - 48C credits reduced to 15% ITC
   - 30D consumer credits maintained (political popularity)
   - Probability: 30%

3. **Scenario C: IRA Repealed (Severe Risk)**
   - All IRA battery incentives eliminated
   - Reversion to pre-2022 policy environment
   - Consumer credits potentially maintained via separate legislation
   - Probability: 10%

**Analysis Period:** 2025-2030 (policy changes assumed to occur 2025-2026)

---

### 6.2 Scenario A: IRA Maintained (Base Case)

**Policy Framework:**
- Full IRA incentives maintained through 2030 and beyond
- Domestic content requirements phase in as scheduled (2024: 50% battery components, 2029: 100%)
- Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions enforced (limits Chinese materials)

**Impact on Supply (2030):**
- **Announced Capacity:** 1,350 GWh (as forecasted)
- **Realization Rate:** 75-80% (strong project economics support completion)
- **Realized Capacity:** 1,013-1,080 GWh
- **Effective Supply:** 730-780 GWh

**Impact on Demand (2030):**
- **EV Sales:** 7.0M (40% market share)
- **EV Battery Demand:** 525 GWh
- **Grid Storage:** 185 GWh
- **Total Demand:** 710 GWh

**Supply-Demand Balance (2030):** +20 to +70 GWh surplus

**Economic Impact (Cumulative 2023-2030):**
- **Manufacturing Investment:** $80-90 billion
- **Direct Jobs Created:** 200,000+
- **Federal Tax Credits Disbursed:** $60-70 billion (45X, 48C, 30D combined)
- **Federal Tax Revenue (from operations):** $15-20 billion (corporate taxes, payroll taxes)

**Self-Sufficiency:** Achieved 2029-2030

**Technology Mix:**
- Diverse chemistry mix (LFP, NMC, emerging technologies)
- Competitive cost trajectory: $58/kWh (2030)

**Risks:**
- Potential overcapacity by 2031-2032 if demand softer than forecast
- FEOC restrictions may limit access to low-cost Chinese materials (higher costs)

**Likelihood:** Base case for all forecasts in this report

---

### 6.3 Scenario B: IRA Modified (Moderate Risk)

**Policy Framework:**
- 45X credits reduced 50%: $17.50/kWh cells, $5/kWh modules (2026 policy change)
- 48C credits reduced to 15% ITC (from 30%)
- Consumer 30D credits maintained (political popularity protects demand-side incentives)

**Impact on Supply (2030):**

**Project Economics Impact:**
- Marginal projects (smaller companies, lower-margin facilities) become uneconomic
- Example: 30 GWh facility with 45X credits contributed $1.05B over 10 years; at 50% reduction, only $525M
- Companies with weaker balance sheets cancel/delay projects

**Capacity Adjustments:**
- **Announced Capacity:** 1,350 GWh (same announcements, but lower completion rate)
- **Realization Rate:** 60-65% (down from 75-80%)
- **Realized Capacity:** 810-880 GWh
- **Effective Supply:** 580-630 GWh (2030)

**Projects Most at Risk:**
- Pre-revenue startups (Freyr Battery, Eos Energy expansion)
- Facilities without OEM offtake agreements (spec capacity)
- Smaller facilities (<10 GWh) with higher per-GWh costs

**Estimated Cancellations/Delays:** 150-200 GWh of announced capacity

**Impact on Demand (2030):**
- **EV Sales:** 6.5M (37% market share, slight reduction due to higher battery costs)
- **Battery Demand:** 655 GWh (525 EV + 130 grid - grid storage more sensitive to cost)

**Supply-Demand Balance (2030):** -25 to -75 GWh deficit

**Economic Impact (Cumulative 2023-2030):**
- **Manufacturing Investment:** $60-65 billion (vs $80-90B in Scenario A)
- **Direct Jobs Created:** 140,000 (vs 200,000 in Scenario A)
- **Federal Tax Credits Disbursed:** $35-40 billion (vs $60-70B in Scenario A)

**Self-Sufficiency:** Delayed to 2032-2033 (vs 2029-2030 in Scenario A)

**Technology Mix Impact:**
- Shift toward lower-cost LFP accelerates (60% share vs 53% in Scenario A)
- Premium NMC facilities more likely to be delayed (higher capex, reliant on credits)
- Potential slowdown in emerging technology investment (solid-state, advanced chemistries)

**Cost Trajectory:**
- 2030 Pack Cost: $62-65/kWh (vs $58/kWh in Scenario A)
- Slower learning curve due to reduced cumulative production

**Regional Impact:**
- Southeastern "Battery Belt" consolidation (surviving projects in GA, KY, TN)
- Marginal states (NY, PA, Western facilities) face higher cancellation risk

**Probability:** 30% (potential policy change post-2024 election, budget reconciliation)

---

### 6.4 Scenario C: IRA Repealed (Severe Risk)

**Policy Framework:**
- All IRA battery manufacturing incentives repealed (45X, 48C) - hypothetical 2025-2026 repeal
- Consumer 30D credits potentially maintained via separate legislation (political difficulty of full repeal)
- Reversion to pre-IRA policy landscape

**Impact on Supply (2030):**

**Project Economics Collapse:**
- Many gigafactory projects designed around 45X credit economics (~$1B+ NPV contribution for large facilities)
- Without credits, only projects with:
  1. Locked-in OEM contracts (captive demand)
  2. Strong balance sheets (can absorb losses during ramp)
  3. Existing construction commitments (sunk costs)

**Capacity Adjustments:**
- **Announced Capacity:** 1,350 GWh (same announcements)
- **Realization Rate:** 45-50% (severe contraction)
- **Realized Capacity:** 610-675 GWh
- **Effective Supply:** 430-480 GWh (2030)

**Projects Most Likely to Proceed:**
- **Tesla Gigafactory Nevada:** Captive demand (Tesla vehicles)
- **GM-LG Ultium Cells:** Joint venture with OEM, committed
- **Ford-SK BlueOval SK:** Under construction, OEM backing
- **SK On Georgia:** Advanced construction, strategic investment
- **Panasonic Kansas:** Tesla contract, committed

**Projects Likely Canceled/Delayed:**
- Standalone merchant facilities (no OEM partner)
- All pre-revenue startup expansions (Freyr, Eos, etc.)
- Facilities not yet in construction phase as of 2025
- Smaller facilities (<20 GWh) with marginal economics

**Estimated Cancellations/Delays:** 450-550 GWh of announced capacity

**Impact on Demand (2030):**
- **EV Sales:** 5.5-6.0M (32-35% market share)
- **Battery Demand:** 590 GWh (450 EV + 140 grid)
- Demand reduction due to:
  1. Higher battery costs (less investment in cost reduction)
  2. Slower EV adoption (if consumer credits also eliminated)
  3. Grid storage projects less competitive vs gas peakers

**Supply-Demand Balance (2030):** -110 to -160 GWh deficit

**Economic Impact (Cumulative 2023-2030):**
- **Manufacturing Investment:** $35-45 billion (vs $80-90B in Scenario A)
- **Direct Jobs Created:** 80,000-100,000 (vs 200,000 in Scenario A)
- **Federal Tax Credits Disbursed:** $10-15 billion (only pre-repeal credits)
- **Lost Economic Activity:** $40-50 billion in foregone investment

**Self-Sufficiency:** NOT ACHIEVED by 2030
- Import dependence remains at 20-25% through 2035
- U.S. continues reliance on South Korean, Japanese imports

**Technology Mix Impact:**
- Consolidation around lowest-cost technologies (LFP dominance: 70%+ share)
- Innovation stalls: Solid-state, advanced materials companies lose U.S. investment
- Potential brain drain: Battery engineers/scientists move to China, EU

**Cost Trajectory:**
- 2030 Pack Cost: $68-72/kWh (vs $58/kWh in Scenario A)
- Slower learning curve, reduced R&D investment

**Geopolitical Impact:**
- U.S. cedes battery manufacturing leadership to China, EU
- Continued dependence on imports for critical technology
- National security implications (EV adoption for government fleets slowed)

**Regional Impact:**
- Midwest/Southeast automotive corridor loses 100,000+ manufacturing jobs
- States with heavy battery investment (GA, MI, KY, TN, NV) face economic setbacks

**Probability:** 10% (politically difficult to fully repeal given sunk investments, job creation)

**Mitigation Factors:**
- State-level incentives may partially compensate (GA, MI, NV have large state programs)
- Some projects may proceed at slower pace (phased buildout vs full-scale gigafactories)
- International partnerships (Canadian, Australian mineral supply) may provide alternative support

#### Comparative Metrics Table (2030 Outcomes)

| Metric | Scenario A (IRA Maintained) | Scenario B (IRA Modified) | Scenario C (IRA Repealed) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Realized Capacity (GWh)** | 1,013-1,080 | 810-880 | 610-675 |
| **Effective Supply (GWh)** | 730-780 | 580-630 | 430-480 |
| **Total Demand (GWh)** | 710 | 655 | 590 |
| **Supply-Demand Balance** | +20 to +70 | -25 to -75 | -110 to -160 |

| **Self-Sufficiency Year** | 2029-2030 | 2032-2033 | Not by 2035 |
| **2030 Pack Cost ($/kWh)** | $58 | $62-65 | $68-72 |
| **EV Market Share (2030)** | 40% | 37% | 32-35% |

#### Probability-Weighted Outlook

**Expected Value Calculation (2030 Effective Supply):**
```
E(Supply) = 0.60 × 755 GWh + 0.30 × 605 GWh + 0.10 × 455 GWh
E(Supply) = 453 + 182 + 46
E(Supply) = 681 GWh
```

**Probability-Weighted Supply-Demand Balance:**
- Expected Supply: 681 GWh
- Expected Demand: 694 GWh (weighted by scenario probabilities)
- **Expected Deficit: -13 GWh (2% import dependence)**

**Interpretation:**
- Accounting for policy risk, U.S. likely achieves ~98% self-sufficiency by 2030
- Material risk of import dependence continuing if IRA modified/repealed
- Base case (IRA maintained) remains most likely outcome (60% probability)

### 6.6 Policy Recommendations

#### For Federal Policymakers

**1. Maintain IRA Incentives Through 2030 (Minimum)**
- **Rationale:** $60-70B in federal credits generates $80-90B in private investment (1.2-1.4× multiplier)
- **Impact:** Ensures 2029-2030 self-sufficiency vs 2032-2033 delay or failure to achieve
- **Job Creation:** 200,000 jobs vs 80,000-140,000 in alternative scenarios

**2. Provide Long-Term Policy Certainty Beyond 2030**
- **Issue:** Current 45X credits sunset 2032; creates investment uncertainty for 2027-2030 project decisions
- **Recommendation:** Extend 45X through 2035 (with potential phase-down: 100% → 75% → 50%)
- **Rationale:** Battery gigafactories have 10-15 year investment horizons; policy certainty de-risks capital allocation

**3. Streamline FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) Guidance**
- **Issue:** Uncertainty around Chinese material sourcing limits project finalization
- **Recommendation:** Clear safe harbor guidance for transitional sourcing (e.g., 2024-2027 grace period for graphite)
- **Rationale:** Domestic/allied graphite refining capacity insufficient until 2028+; inflexibility risks project delays

**4. Coordinate Federal-State Incentive Alignment**
- **Issue:** State incentive packages vary widely (GA: $1.8B for Hyundai, NY: limited programs)
- **Recommendation:** Federal matching grants for state battery manufacturing incentives
- **Rationale:** Reduces interstate bidding wars, spreads investment more evenly

#### For State Policymakers

**1. Target Strategic Facility Types**
- **Grid Storage Focus:** States with aggressive renewable targets (CA, NY, TX) should prioritize grid storage manufacturing
- **EV Battery Focus:** Automotive corridor states (MI, OH, IN, GA, TN, KY) leverage existing supply chains

**2. Workforce Development Investment**
- **Challenge:** 200,000 jobs require skilled workforce (chemical engineering, manufacturing, quality control)
- **Recommendation:** State funding for community college battery technician programs (2-year degrees)
- **Example:** Kentucky allocated $50M for workforce training tied to BlueOval SK facility

**3. Permitting Streamlining**
- **Issue:** Environmental permitting for gigafactories can take 12-24 months
- **Recommendation:** Dedicated battery manufacturing permit track (similar to semiconductor CHIPS Act provisions)

#### For Industry

**1. Accelerate Technology Commercialization**
- **Gap:** Solid-state, sodium-ion, advanced materials still in pilot phase
- **Recommendation:** Industry consortia for pilot-to-production scale-up (share learnings, reduce risk)

**2. Demand Aggregation for Merchant Facilities**
- **Risk:** Facilities without OEM offtake agreements face higher cancellation risk
- **Recommendation:** Multi-OEM purchasing consortia (similar to European Battery Alliance model)

**3. Regional Supply Chain Integration**
- **Opportunity:** Southeastern U.S. becoming "Battery Belt"
- **Recommendation:** Co-locate cathode, anode, separator plants near gigafactories (reduce logistics costs, carbon footprint)

### Final Assessment

The U.S. battery industry is on track to achieve self-sufficiency by 2029-2030, transforming from 69% import dependence (2024) to a net exporter position. This represents one of the most significant industrial policy successes in recent decades, driven by the Inflation Reduction Act's strategic incentives. However, this trajectory is contingent on policy maintenance, execution of announced projects, and sustained consumer EV adoption. The 2027-2032 period will be critical for securing long-term competitiveness through next-generation technology investments and supply chain resilience.
