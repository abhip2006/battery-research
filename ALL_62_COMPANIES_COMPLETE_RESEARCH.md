The DOE LPO has committed over $20 billion to battery manufacturing, with BlueOval SK ($9.63B) and StarPlus Energy ($7.54B) receiving the largest loans. This represents unprecedented federal support for domestic battery supply chain development.

### 2. Joint Venture Dominance
Major automakers (GM, Ford, Stellantis) have chosen joint venture structures with Korean battery manufacturers (LG, SK, Samsung) rather than fully integrated in-house production, with combined capacity exceeding 230 GWh.

### 3. Geographic Concentration
Battery manufacturing concentrates in specific corridors:
- **Southeast Battery Belt:** Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky
- **Midwest Cluster:** Michigan, Ohio, Indiana
- **Western Hub:** Nevada, Washington

### 4. Technology Diversification
While lithium-ion dominates (35%), significant investment exists in:
- Solid-state (QuantumScape, Solid Power)
- Iron-air/flow (Form Energy, ESS Tech)
- Silicon anode enablers (Sila, Group14)

### 5. Recycling Ecosystem Emerging
Dedicated infrastructure built by Redwood Materials ($2B DOE loan), Ascend Elements ($480M DOE grants), Li-Cycle, and ABAT.

### 6. Chinese Technology Concerns
Ford-CATL licensing and Gotion's expansion face political opposition, highlighting supply chain security vs. cost tensions.
