---

### **2. What Are the 3 Biggest Risks to U.S. Battery Industry?**

#### **RISK #1: IRA Modification or Repeal (40% Probability)**

**Current Policy:**
- **45X Production Credit:** $35/kWh cells, $10/kWh modules (2023-2032, phasing down)
- **48C Investment Credit:** 30% of qualified investment (tax credits)
- **30D Consumer Credit:** $7,500 EV purchase incentive

**Threat:**
- **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA):** Passed 2025, phases out 30D consumer credit by September 2025
- **Potential 45X Cuts:** 50% reduction ($17.50/kWh) or full repeal under budget reconciliation

**Impact Analysis (if IRA Repealed):**

| Metric | Base Case (IRA Maintained) | IRA Repealed Scenario |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| 2030 Realized Capacity | 1,013 GWh | 643 GWh (-370 GWh) |
| 2030 Effective Supply | 730 GWh | 455 GWh (-275 GWh) |
| Jobs Created | 200,000 | 90,000 (-110,000) |
| Import Dependence 2030 | 0% | 23% |
| Self-Sufficiency | 2029-2030 | Not by 2035 |

**Why This Matters:**
- Gigafactory economics designed around 45X credits (~$1B+ NPV for 30 GWh facility over 10 years)
- Without credits, only projects with locked-in OEM contracts or vertical integration (Tesla) survive
- U.S. cedes battery manufacturing leadership to China, Europe

**Mitigation:**
- State incentives partially compensate (GA: $1.8B for Hyundai, KY: $285M for BlueOval SK)
- Sunk costs create political pressure to maintain (62,700 jobs already created as of June 2025)
- Bipartisan support in battery manufacturing states (GA, MI, TN governors defending investments)

**Recommended Action:**
- **Policymakers:** Maintain IRA through 2030 minimum; extend to 2035 for long-term certainty
- **Industry:** Accelerate construction schedules to lock in credits; diversify revenue beyond IRA-dependent projects

---

#### **RISK #2: Supply Chain Gaps – Critical Materials Dependency (HIGH)**

**The Chokepoint: Lithium, Graphite, Cathode Materials**

**Current U.S. Import Dependence:**
- **Lithium:** 80%+ imported (Chile, Australia, China)
  - *Only 1 U.S. mine operational:* Albemarle Silver Peak, NV
  - *Thacker Pass (NV):* GM-Lithium Americas JV, $650M, not yet operational
- **Graphite:** 95%+ imported (China dominates 65% global refining)
  - *Domestic production:* Nouveau Monde Graphite (Quebec) = first North American source
- **Cathode Active Materials (CAM):** 60%+ imported
  - *Announced U.S. capacity:* ~150K tonnes/year by 2027 vs. 800+ GWh cell demand
  - *Gap:* Insufficient to support full domestic supply chain

**Technology Vulnerability:**

| Component | Cost Share | Import Dependence | U.S. Capacity 2027 | Mitigation Status |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Cathode Materials | 40% of cell cost | 60%+ | 150K tonnes/year | ⚠️ Insufficient |
| Anode (Graphite) | 15-20% | 95%+ | Limited (NMG Quebec) | 🔴 Critical Gap |
| Electrolyte | 8-10% | 80%+ | Minimal | 🔴 Critical Gap |
| Separator | 5-7% | 70%+ | ENTEK (IN): 3.2B sq m/year (2027) | 🟡 Improving |

**Geopolitical Scenario:**
- **China Export Restrictions:** If China restricts lithium, graphite, or cathode exports (Taiwan tensions scenario):
  - Material costs spike +15-25%
  - U.S. battery costs: $58/kWh → $70-75/kWh (2030)
  - EV adoption delayed, -80-100 GWh demand shortfall

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Recycling:** Redwood Materials, Ascend Elements, Li-Cycle targeting 30-40% of material inputs by 2030
2. **Allied Sourcing:** Australia (lithium), Canada (graphite, lithium hydroxide), Chile (lithium)
3. **Technology Substitution:** LFP reduces cobalt/nickel dependence (no cobalt, minimal nickel vs. NMC)
4. **DOE Strategic Reserve:** Proposed battery material stockpile (similar to petroleum reserve)

**Recommended Action:**
- **Policymakers:** Extend 45X credits to cathode/anode production (currently cells/modules only); fast-track mining permits
- **Industry:** Vertical integration (Tesla lithium refining, Redwood cathode production); long-term supply contracts

---

#### **RISK #3: Project Realization & Execution Failures (35% Probability)**

**Historical Context:** Not all announced gigafactories materialize.

**Global Realization Rates (2015-2023):**
- Secured financing + OEM partnership: 90% realization
- Announced without financing details: 50-60% realization
- **Industry average:** 70-75%

**U.S.-Specific Adjustment:** 75-80% (IRA improves economics, but still significant risk)

**Projects Most at Risk (2024-2030):**

| Risk Category | Examples | Probability of Delay/Cancellation | Capacity at Risk |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-revenue startups** | FREYR Battery, Eos Energy expansion | 60-70% | ~80 GWh |
| **Facilities without OEM offtake** | Merchant capacity (no committed buyers) | 50-60% | ~120 GWh |
| **Smaller facilities (<15 GWh)** | Marginal unit economics | 40-50% | ~90 GWh |
| **Pre-IRA announcements** | Projects without updated economics | 30-40% | ~60 GWh |

**Recent Failure Case Study: Northvolt (November 2024)**
- **Profile:** Swedish battery champion, $12B peak valuation, $10B+ raised
- **Failure:** Achieved only 1 GWh vs. 16 GWh target; BMW canceled $2B contract
- **Chapter 11 Filing:** $5.8B debt, $30M cash
- **Lesson:** Even massive funding + government support + OEM partnerships ≠ guaranteed success without execution

**Recommended Action:**
- **Investors:** Favor facilities with 60-80% capacity under long-term offtake agreements; avoid pre-revenue plays
- **Industry:** Phased buildout (10-20 GWh Phase 1, expand if demand materializes); partner with experienced manufacturers (LG, Panasonic playbooks)

### **FOR POLICYMAKERS: IRA Effectiveness + Recommendations**

#### **IRA Report Card: What Worked, What Didn't**

**GRADE: A- (Highly Effective, with Room for Improvement)**

**What Worked:**

**1. 45X Production Tax Credit = Most Effective Tool**
- **Structure:** $35/kWh cells, $10/kWh modules (production-based)
- **Impact:** 686% surge in battery/EV manufacturing investment (Q2 2022 - Q2 2024)
- **Why It Worked:**
  - Incentivizes actual production (vs. announced capacity)
  - Transferable credits (Section 6418) allow non-taxpaying startups to monetize
  - Simple, predictable economics (vs. complex loan application process)

**ROI Calculation:**
- Federal credits: $60-70B (45X, 48C, 30D combined through 2030)
- Private investment leveraged: $80-90B
- **Multiplier:** 1.2-1.4× (every $1 federal → $1.20-1.40 private)
- Jobs created: 200,000 direct (2030) @ $300,000 per job in credits

**Comparison to ARRA (2009 Battery Grants):**
- ARRA: $2.4B grants → $5B private investment (2.1× multiplier), but high failure rate (A123, Ener1 bankruptcies)
- IRA: Production-based credits avoid "picking winners" problem

**2. Domestic Content Requirements = Supply Chain Forcing Function**
- **FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) Rules:** Prohibit Chinese batteries for 30D consumer credit
- **Impact:** 26 EV models eligible (Aug 2024) vs. 18 (Jan 2024) despite restrictions
- **Why It Worked:** Forced OEMs to secure U.S./allied supply (Hyundai GA plant enables $7,500 credit)

**3. State Competition = Geographic Diversification**
- Southeast "Battery Belt" emerged organically (GA, KY, TN, NC)
- 15 states with gigafactory commitments (vs. historical concentration in MI, CA)

**What Didn't Work (or Needs Improvement):**

**1. Upstream Supply Chain Gaps**
- **Problem:** 45X credits cover cells/modules, but NOT cathode/anode/electrolyte production
- **Result:** 60%+ import dependence for cathode materials, 95%+ for graphite
- **Fix:** Extend 45X credits to material production ($15/kg cathode, $10/kg anode)

**2. FEOC Uncertainty**
- **Problem:** Vague "Foreign Entity of Concern" definitions created compliance uncertainty
- **Result:** Project delays, legal costs, conservative sourcing (avoided borderline suppliers)
- **Fix:** Clear safe harbor provisions; transition timelines for Chinese materials (e.g., "graphite: 2027-2028 grace period")

**3. Solid-State / Next-Gen Exclusion**
- **Problem:** 45X credits favor mature Li-ion; solid-state/sodium-ion minimal support until commercial scale
- **Result:** Innovation concentrated in China (CATL sodium-ion 200 Wh/kg by 2027)
- **Fix:** Pilot production credits (e.g., $100/kWh for <1 GWh facilities testing new chemistries)

**4. Grid Storage vs. EV Imbalance**
- **Problem:** 30D consumer credit massive ($7,500 per vehicle) vs. 48C grid storage (30% ITC, one-time)
- **Result:** Grid storage deployments slower than needed for renewables integration
- **Fix:** Make 48C standalone storage ITC permanent (currently expires 2032)

#### **Policy Recommendations for Future Programs**

**PRIORITY 1: Maintain IRA Through 2030 (Minimum), Extend to 2035**
- **Justification:** Gigafactories have 10-15 year investment horizons; policy certainty critical
- **Proposal:** 45X credits phase-down timeline: 100% (2023-2029) → 75% (2030-2032) → 50% (2033-2035) → sunset
- **Budget Impact:** Additional $20-30B over 2030-2035, but generates $25-40B private investment

**PRIORITY 2: Upstream Supply Chain Credits (NEW)**
- **Cathode Active Materials (CAM):** $15/kg production credit
- **Anode Materials (Graphite, Silicon):** $10/kg production credit
- **Electrolyte:** $5/kg production credit
- **Target:** 50% domestic material supply by 2030 (vs. <30% current trajectory)
- **Cost:** $3-5B annually (2026-2030)

**PRIORITY 3: Fast-Track Mining Permits (Lithium, Graphite)**
- **Current Problem:** Thacker Pass lithium mine (NV) = 7+ years permitting
- **Proposal:** National security exemption for critical minerals (similar to defense projects)
- **Target:** 18-24 month maximum permitting for battery materials
- **Precedent:** CHIPS Act semiconductor permitting provisions

**PRIORITY 4: Recycling Mandates + EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility)**
- **Proposal:** Federal minimum recycled content requirement (10% by 2028, 30% by 2035)
- **Mechanism:** EPR laws require battery manufacturers to fund end-of-life collection
- **Impact:** Guarantees feedstock for Redwood Materials, Li-Cycle, Ascend Elements
- **Co-benefit:** Reduces lithium import dependence by 20-30% (2030)

**PRIORITY 5: Workforce Development (National Battery Technician Program)**
- **Gap:** 200,000 jobs require skilled workforce; insufficient pipeline
- **Proposal:** Federal funding for community college programs ($500M over 5 years)
- **Target:** 50,000 trained technicians by 2028
- **Model:** Tennessee College of Applied Technology (BlueOval SK partnership)

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS BY STAKEHOLDER TYPE

### **INVESTORS**

**TOP 5 ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Overweight Materials/Recycling vs. Cell Manufacturing**
   - **Rationale:** Cell manufacturing = commodity risk (overcapacity, margin compression); materials = chokepoint, higher margins
   - **Targets:** Albemarle (lithium), Redwood Materials (recycling + cathode), Livent (lithium chemicals)
   - **Allocation:** 60% materials/recycling, 30% integrated players (Tesla, LG), 10% high-risk (QuantumScape)

2. **Favor OEM-Backed JVs Over Standalone Cell Manufacturers**
   - **Winners:** GM-LG Ultium, Ford-SK BlueOval SK, Stellantis-Samsung StarPlus (captive demand reduces market risk)
   - **Losers:** FREYR Battery, Eos Energy (merchant capacity without committed offtake)

3. **Grid Storage = Lower Volatility Than EV**
   - **Thesis:** Utility-scale storage policy-driven (state mandates), less consumer-dependent
   - **Targets:** Fluence Energy (BESS integrator), Form Energy (iron-air long-duration), ESS Tech (iron flow)
   - **Entry Point:** Wait for 2025-2026 correction (potential overcapacity in 4-hour Li-ion segment)

4. **2027-2032 = Next Investment Wave (Emerging Capacity Gap)**
   - **Opportunity:** 2035 demand (~1,375 GWh) exceeds current capacity trajectory
   - **Timing:** Position 2026-2027 for next wave of gigafactory announcements (300-500 GWh needed)
   - **Focus:** Solid-state scale-up (QuantumScape, Solid Power if commercialization successful), LMFP chemistry, long-duration storage

5. **Hedge Policy Risk**
   - **Strategy:** Diversify across IRA-dependent (Ultium, StarPlus) and IRA-resilient (Tesla vertical integration, Albemarle lithium) companies
   - **Hedge:** 20-30% allocation to non-U.S. battery exposure (CATL, BYD via Hong Kong listings) in case IRA repealed

**AVOID LIST:**
- Pre-revenue startups with <18 months cash runway (Eos Energy at risk)
- Facilities in states without strong incentive packages (limited Northeast exposure)
- Alternative chemistries (sodium-ion, zinc) targeting EV market before 2030 (grid storage OK)

---

### **POLICYMAKERS**

**TOP 5 ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Maintain IRA Through 2030 (Minimum), Extend to 2035**
   - **Justification:** ROI = 1.2-1.4× multiplier ($60-70B credits → $80-90B private investment)
   - **Impact:** Self-sufficiency 2029-2030 vs. 2032-2033 delay (if modified) or not achieved (if repealed)
   - **Political Strategy:** Bipartisan support in battery states (GA, MI, KY, TN governors); 62,700 jobs already created

2. **Extend 45X Credits to Upstream Materials**
   - **Gap:** Cathode (60% import), graphite (95% import), electrolyte (80% import)
   - **Proposal:** $15/kg CAM, $10/kg anode, $5/kg electrolyte production credits
   - **Cost:** $3-5B annually, but achieves 50% domestic material supply by 2030

3. **Fast-Track Mining Permits (Lithium, Graphite)**
   - **Current:** Thacker Pass lithium mine = 7+ years permitting
   - **Proposal:** National security exemption, 18-24 month maximum
   - **Model:** CHIPS Act semiconductor permitting provisions

4. **Recycling Mandates + Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)**
   - **Mechanism:** Minimum 10% recycled content by 2028, 30% by 2035
   - **Impact:** Guarantees feedstock for Redwood, Li-Cycle, Ascend Elements; reduces lithium import 20-30%

5. **Workforce Development (National Battery Technician Program)**
   - **Gap:** 200,000 jobs, insufficient skilled workforce
   - **Proposal:** $500M federal funding for community college programs (50,000 technicians by 2028)
   - **Model:** Tennessee College of Applied Technology (BlueOval SK partnership)

---

### **INDUSTRY (OEMs + Cell Manufacturers)**

**TOP 5 ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Diversify Chemistry Portfolios (LFP + NMC Flexibility)**
   - **Rationale:** Technology uncertainty requires hedging; consumer preference shift toward LFP (cost) vs. NMC (range)
   - **Action:** Design facilities for chemistry flexibility (equipment changes allow LFP→NMC switch in 6-12 months)
   - **Example:** Ultium Cells facilities designed for NMC but can shift to LMFP

2. **Secure Long-Term Offtake Agreements (60-80% Capacity)**
   - **Risk Mitigation:** Merchant facilities without committed buyers face higher financing costs, cancellation risk
   - **Target:** 5-10 year contracts with OEMs, grid storage developers
   - **Benchmark:** BlueOval SK (100% Ford captive), Ultium (GM captive) = lowest financing risk

3. **Vertical Integration into Materials (Cathode, Anode, Recycling)**
   - **Rationale:** Materials = 50-60% of cell cost; integration captures margin, secures supply
   - **Action:** Acquire or partner with material suppliers (Redwood Materials, Ascend Elements)
   - **Example:** Tesla investing in lithium refining (Texas), planned cathode production

4. **Geographic Clustering (Southeast "Battery Belt")**
   - **Rationale:** Battery weight (1,000-1,500 lbs/pack) makes logistics expensive; co-location with OEM assembly saves 15-25%
   - **Target States:** GA, KY, TN (OEM concentration, state incentives, workforce)
   - **Avoid:** Standalone facilities far from OEM assembly (logistics penalty)

5. **Phased Buildout Strategy (Reduce Execution Risk)**
   - **Model:** Start with 10-20 GWh Phase 1, expand to 40-50 GWh Phase 2 if demand materializes
   - **Rationale:** Reduces capital at risk if demand slower than forecast (EV adoption uncertainty)
   - **Example:** Panasonic Kansas (30 GWh Phase 1, expansion capacity reserved)
